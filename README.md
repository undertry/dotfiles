## 📦 About

This repository is a snapshot of my daily Linux setup – a polished, functional, and aesthetically pleasing development environment. It includes:

- 💻 **Fish Shell** with custom functions and abbreviations
- ✨ **Helix Editor** with clean, modal editing and configuration
- 🧩 Integration with my [NixOS](https://github.com/undertry/NixOS) flake-based setup
- 🎨 A full "rice" setup: WM, terminal, launcher, GTK themes, and more
